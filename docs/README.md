# Zelda a Link to Pokemon World

What is The Legend of Zelda: A Link to Pokemon World?
	
	It's a project for a subject called Project 2 of Video Games Design and Development  
	degree at Centre de la Imatge i Multimèdia (CITM), Terrassa. 
	It's an action RPG game based on the original "A Link to The past" (1991, SNES)
	and mixed with Pokémon Emerald (2004, GBA). 
	We have taken the essence of Zelda: a Link to the Past and 
	added our personal touch: an amazing journey to the Pokémon World. Link will become the best Pokémon 
	trainer after fighting against some of them with his sword on his hand. Ganon has rapped the princess 
	Zelda and you will have to do this travel to rescue her.

THE POKÉMON COMBAT
	
	You will have 3 Pokémon with a melee and a special attack, that will do more damage to the Pokémon enemy. The special attack
	has got a cooldown time to be cast again. At the moment, enemy IA won't attack you. It's only a test to see how this mechanic
	will work. (different Pokémon with different attacks and types that will do more or less damage depending the Pokémon).
	

WIN/LOSE CONDITIONS
	
	If you are defeated in Zelda World, the game will be restarted at the start of the last level you were playing.
	If you are defeated in Victory Road, the game is restarted the same way as Zelda World.
	
	YOU WIN THE GAME when you defeat Ganon, the Final Boss. A final cutscene appears and you are teleported to the Link's House again.
