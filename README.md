What is The Legend of Zelda: A Link to Pokemon World?
	
	It's a project for a subject called Project 2 of Video Games Design and Development  
	degree at Centre de la Imatge i Multimèdia (CITM), Terrassa. 
	It's an action RPG game based on the original "A Link to The past" (1991, SNES)
	and mixed with Pokémon Emerald (2004, GBA). 
	We have taken the essence of Zelda: a Link to the Past and 
	added our personal touch: an amazing journey to the Pokémon World. Link will become the best Pokémon 
	trainer after fighting against some of them with his sword on his hand. Ganon has rapped the princess 
	Zelda and you will have to do this travel to rescue her.

OBJECTIVE
	
	The main objective of this Vertical Slice is to show you the potential of our game through the core mechanics. We have divided
	it into 3 different parts:
		1st STAGE -> we are in Kakariko Village. Fight agains some soldiers to reach the "magic hole".

		2nd STAGE -> We are teletransported into the Victory Road of Hoenn, a beautiful region of the Pokémon World. Link is
			     confused, so he will explore this big cave to come back to his home.
			     - FIRST FLOOR > explore this level until achieve the hookshot inside a big chest. You will be able to pass across
			     the broken bridges, with the help of sudowoodos (the Pokémon Tree)
			     - SECOND FLOOR > big rocks will block your path, so take the bombs inside the other big chest and place them next
			     to the rocks. You will wake up the slept golems, and will chase you annoy them.
		3rd STAGE -> Wou will be in the combat arena, where Brendan will give you a little taste of an intense Pokémon Combat.

THE POKÉMON COMBAT
	
	You will have 3 Pokémon with a melee and a special attack, that will do more damage to the Pokémon enemy. The special attack
	has got a cooldown time to be cast again. At the moment, enemy IA won't attack you. It's only a test to see how this mechanic
	will work. (different Pokémon with different attacks & types that will do more or less damage depending the Pokémon).
